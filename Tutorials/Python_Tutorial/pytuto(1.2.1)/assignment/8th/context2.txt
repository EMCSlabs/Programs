I've always enjoyed your class for the past two years. 
When I first came to you and told you about my difficulties in your class, 
you gave me words of encouragement I will never forget. 
I didn't get an A in your class, but it was always interesting. 
I know you've helped so many students for the twenty years you've 
worked at Bayside High. Now I'm sad that Bayside High is 
losing one of its greatest teachers. 
I appreciate all the effort you've put in teaching 
and wish you a happy retirement.
