There is a very important rule. If we obey that rule, 
we shall never get into trouble. In fact, that rule, 
if obeyed, will bring us a lot of friends and constant happiness. 
But the very instant we break the rule, 
we shall get into endless trouble. 
The rule is this: Always make the other person feel important. 
John Dewey, one of the famous thinkers in America, 
said that humans have a strong desire to be important. 
It is this desire that makes us different from the animals.
