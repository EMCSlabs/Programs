It seems clear that children need nature. 
But they are fast getting far from it. 
A growing number of children do not know 
the real meaning of going on a hike, camping, or fishing. 
National parks are good places for older people to go, 
but it seems that children don't find hiking boots cool. 
It isn't just national forests that young people are avoiding. 
Kids these days aren't digging holes, building tree houses, 
catching frogs, or playing by the stream. 
Nature is becoming just a scene children watch on a nature TV channel.
