Think of your life as an hourglass. 
The thousands of grains of sand in 
the top of the hourglass all pass slowly 
and evenly through the narrow neck on the middle, 
one grain of sand at a time. 
You and I and everyone else are like this hourglass. 
When we start in the morning, 
we feel we must do hundreds of tasks that day. 
But if we do not take them one at a time and let 
them pass through the day slowly and evenly, 
we are certain to feel stress and fail to achieve our goal. 
Before a mass of tasks, always remember one task at a time.
You can then carry out your tasks successfully feeling less stress.
