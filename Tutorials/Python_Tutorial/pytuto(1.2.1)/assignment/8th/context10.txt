You might think it doesn't matter whether you exercise in the morning, 
afternoon or evening. And many people exercise 
in the evening because evening exercise seems more convenient. 
But research shows that people who exercise later 
in the day have more difficulty sleeping. 
However, exercising in the morning can increase your energy for the day. 
It will wake up your body in ways that a cold shower 
or a good breakfast simply can't accomplish. 
Other research also shows starting the day actively 
with morning exercise is the key to losing weight.
