Sabriye Tenberken is an extraordinary woman. 
She runs a school for blind children in Tibet. 
Born in Germany, she lost her sight at 13.

In college, she studied the history of Tibet. 
Afterward, she flew off to Tibet. 
There she rode a horse along mountain cliffs to distant villages, 
looking for blind children for her school. 
She teaches her students that they can do anything.

highest mountain. She says Blind children will never be able to drive, 
but they can read and write.
