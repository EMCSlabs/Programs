Did you know that a bright room can make you happier 
and more hardworking? A recent study suggests that
students do better on tests in sunny schools. 
Students are absent less often in these schools, too. 
More surprisingly, children seem to grow taller in schools 
with lots of sunlight. Daylight is also good for business. 
The use of natural light makes customers spend more money in stores. 
In offices, workers who have windows near their desks work harder 
than those who don't. They also miss fewer days of work.
