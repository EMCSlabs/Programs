In my grandmother's garden a rosebud seemed to take 
a long time to bloom. I wanted to see its color and beauty. 
I thought we should do something about it, 
and appealed to Grandmother. 
When she told me to open the petals, 
I was excited. But after the petals were opened, 
there was no beautiful rose. I had destroyed its beauty, 
and the rose quickly dried up and died. Grandmother then 
explained that it was so with all things:
we must let them bloom in their own way and in their own time.
