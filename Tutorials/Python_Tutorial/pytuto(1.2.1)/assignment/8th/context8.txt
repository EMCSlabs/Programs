Aztec children were taught at home until about 15 years of age. 
All children, however, were expected to attend school for some 
time when they were between 16 and 20 years old. 
The school that most of the children attended was called telpochcalli. 
Boys lived at the school to receive their military training for wars. 
The richer or gifted boys attended calmecac. 
Here boys learned to become leaders.
